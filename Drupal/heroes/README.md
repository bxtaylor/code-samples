# Heroes Module

This is a quick module example that does highlights a couple of things:
1. Routing w/ variable inputs.
1. Creating a custom service.
1. Dependency injection.
1. Integration of ReactJS for front-end interaction.
1. Controllers w/ render outputs and JSON outputs.

If I were to expand some of these concepts out, I'd likely start with creating an interface for the API service and 
convert it into more of a factory so that if we wanted to reuse the same concepts across different API sources it would
be easier to implement.

I would also move the configuration out of the code and into an admin form.
